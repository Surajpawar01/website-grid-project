          At Grid Projects we believe you are only as good as your last job, and
          that it takes 90% of<br />
          effort to complete the last 10% of work. So with the majority of our
          work coming from repeat<br />
          customers and referrals we are proud of our track record. Our record
          boasts two major Master<br />
          Builders Association Awards in two years. We believe the building
          process is one of<br />
          partnerships, developing relationships between clients, architects and
          subcontractors<br />
          to achieve an exceptional building product of unsurpassed quality
          through timeliness of service.

          Smooth building site operations play a decisive role in ensuring
          project success. This is why Grid Projects provides complete building
          site logistics–from initial planning through to the post-construction
          phase. It does so in the form of individual services or overall
          project management, as required. The company brings together
          everything needed for site installation, construction operation and
          the optimization of on-site work sequences. We are committed to
          adopting a flexible and open approach towards the needs of our clients
          by listening to and respecting their views, and being ahead of
          emerging trends and potential technological breakthroughs.
